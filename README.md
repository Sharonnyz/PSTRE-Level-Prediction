# Adult’s PSTRE Level Prediction

This project is to be conducted on a (part of) international large-scale assessments for adults –The Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). This study is to use process variables, behavioral variables or background variables, apply supervised machine learning methods, to make a prediction on the problem- solving skill levels (PS_class) as accurate as possible.

## Dataset

- PIAAC_US_2012_subsample.csv

The dataset includes n=664 respondents, all of them took 14 PSTRE items. A total of 588 variables are used, including the gold standard “PS_class” as the final variable.

This document provides a codebook to explains about variable labels and values (esp. for nominal and ordinal variables) in the PIAAC_US_2012_subsample.csv

Variables 3-139 are related to behavioral variables, variables 139-587 are related to background variables, variable 588 is the gold standard “Class”.
